                My name is Lucy Hirst, I am an artist from West Yorkshire, I am mainly looking for jobs in game design but I will take any job in the computer engineering sector as I have put a lot of work into learning computer engineering.
                <br>
                <br>
                The reason I would like to be in the game design field is becuase I would like my art skills to be in use, it is the whole reason I wanted to learn how to code and it's the reason I joined a pre-apprenticeship course with Generation, a non-profit charity organisation, I am currently on the course and it is going well, I went from knowing nothing about coding to knowing enough to be able to make a small game through Javascript.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would gladly take any job in the creative and or computer engineering field and I would also accept jobs in web design.

                    I have been to art school and I learnt multiple skills in the art field, those art skills listed are my main ones, I do have some illustration skills but I have a lot of room for improvement.

                    <br>
                    My skills are mainly technical skills, such as Photoshop, Photography and Photo manipulation, I have learnt a lot of HTML and CSS and I am confident in designing web pages and I am designing this one using CSS and HTML, so skills are paying off.

                    I am a trans goth from Bradford, I enjoy gaming, watching movies and occasionally drawing.
                    <br>
                    I really enjoy RPG games, mainly fantasy ones, such as The Elder Scrolls franchise.
                    <br>
                    I really like horror, fantasy and sci-fi movies.
                    <br>
                    Being trans is really difficult, the UK isn't as accepting of trans people as the LGBTQ+ community would like and that is unfortunate because it makes daily life difficult, I would really like a job that is accepting of trans people and is LGBTQ+ friendly.
